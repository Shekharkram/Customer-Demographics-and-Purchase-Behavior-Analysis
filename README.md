# Customer-Demographics-and-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Customer Demographics and Purchase Behavior Analysis" project. The project focuses on analyzing customer data to uncover insights related to demographics, purchasing behavior, and seasonal trends. 

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure its readiness for analysis.
- Create an age group variable to segment customers into meaningful categories.
- Visualize key patterns in customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and seasonal trends.
- Generate actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and boosting business growth.


## Key Metrics

- **Total Spending**: The total amount spent by customers within each segment or category, helping measure revenue generation by customer group.
- **Average Spending per Customer**: The average amount spent by each customer in a segment, providing insights into high-value customer behavior.
- **Purchase Frequency**: The number of times a customer makes a purchase within a given period, helping identify loyal customers.
- **Product Category Sales Distribution**: The total sales per product category, identifying the most popular and revenue-generating categories.
- **Seasonal Spending Trends**: The total amount spent during each season, identifying peak spending periods and opportunities for seasonal promotions.

## Tasks Performed

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed irrelevant data, and addressed inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Age Group Creation**: Segmented customers into age groups to facilitate better analysis and segmentation.
- **Visualization**: Created various visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar charts) to display insights related to customer demographics, spending behaviors, and seasonal trends.
- **Analysis**: Explored distributions of age, gender, categories, and items purchased, as well as spending patterns across different seasons.

## Key Insights

- **Customer Demographics**: Analysis of age and gender distributions, highlighting key customer segments.
- **Purchase Behavior**: Insights into product category popularity, items purchased, and customer spending.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identified peak seasons for customer spending and purchasing behavior, with opportunities for targeted marketing during off-seasons.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations to display insights.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory analysis and documentation.

## Outcome

- **Price Sensitivity**: Identified customer segments sensitive to pricing for targeted discounts.
- **High-Value Customers**: Pinpointed top-spending customers for loyalty programs.
- **Seasonal Pricing**: Revealed seasonal spending trends to adjust prices for peak/off-peak periods.
